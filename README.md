## <a name="project_description"></a>Project Description:


The goal of this project is to predict Critic Score using a dataframe acquired from Kaggle regarding video games that have been rated by Metacritic within the last 50 years. Using clustering I intend to make new features and explore to find drivers of Critic Score. At which point I will attempt to make a regression model that will beat the baseline prediction.

<u>Data Source</u>

* The data can also be pulled from Kaggle.com 
    * https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings?select=Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv
* This repository also has a CSV of the data available as well
